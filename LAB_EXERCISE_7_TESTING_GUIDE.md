## Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Database Verification
1. Open **phpMyAdmin** (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Select your database
3. Verify the `materials` table exists with the correct schema:
   - id, course_id, file_name, file_path, created_at
4. Check that the foreign key relationship exists (course_id → courses.id)

**✅ TAKE SCREENSHOT**: Materials table schema

---

### Test 2: Admin File Upload
1. Start XAMPP (Apache & MySQL)
2. Open browser: `http://localhost/ITE311-ESYONG/`
3. Login as **Admin**:
   - Check your database for admin credentials
   - Or register and change role to 'admin' in database
4. On dashboard, find a course
5. Click **"Upload Material"** button
6. Select a test file (PDF, DOC, or PPT - max 10MB)
7. Click **"Upload Material"**
8. Verify success message appears
9. Return to dashboard
10. Verify the uploaded file appears in the course materials list

**✅ TAKE SCREENSHOT**: Upload form page
**✅ TAKE SCREENSHOT**: Dashboard showing uploaded material

---

### Test 3: File System Verification
1. Navigate to: `C:\xampp\htdocs\ITE311-ESYONG\writable\uploads\materials\`
2. Verify the uploaded file exists (with random name)
3. Check file permissions (should be readable)

**✅ TAKE SCREENSHOT**: Windows Explorer showing uploaded file in materials folder

---

### Test 4: Student Download (Enrolled)
1. Logout from admin
2. Login as **Student** (or register as student)
3. On dashboard, click **"Enroll"** on the course that has materials
4. After enrollment, verify course appears in "Enrolled Courses"
5. Verify course materials are listed with download icons
6. Click download link
7. Verify file downloads successfully
8. Open downloaded file to confirm it's not corrupted

**✅ TAKE SCREENSHOT**: Student dashboard showing downloadable materials

---

### Test 5: Student Access Control (Not Enrolled)
1. Still logged in as student
2. Find a course you are NOT enrolled in
3. Try to manually access download URL:
   `http://localhost/ITE311-ESYONG/materials/download/1`
   (Use actual material ID from database)
4. Verify you get "Access denied" message

**✅ Expected Result**: Access denied message

---

### Test 6: Teacher Upload & Delete
1. Logout and login as **Teacher**
2. On dashboard, find a course
3. Click **"Upload Material"**
4. Upload a test file (e.g., PPT)
5. Verify success
6. Return to dashboard
7. Find the uploaded material
8. Click **Delete** (trash icon)
9. Confirm deletion
10. Verify material is removed from dashboard
11. Check file system - verify file is deleted

**✅ TAKE SCREENSHOT**: Teacher dashboard with material management

---

### Test 7: File Type Validation
1. Login as Admin or Teacher
2. Go to upload page for any course
3. Try uploading an invalid file type (e.g., .exe, .bat)
4. Verify error message: "File validation failed"

**✅ Expected Result**: Validation error message

---

### Test 8: File Size Validation
1. Try uploading a file larger than 10MB
2. Verify error message appears

**✅ Expected Result**: "max_size" validation error

---

### Test 9: Multiple Materials Per Course
1. Upload 3-5 different materials to the same course
2. Verify all materials appear in the dashboard
3. Verify students can download all of them
4. Check materials are sorted by created_at DESC

**✅ TAKE SCREENSHOT**: Course with multiple materials

---

### Test 10: Direct File Access Prevention
1. Open browser and try to access:
   `http://localhost/ITE311-ESYONG/writable/uploads/materials/`
2. Verify directory listing is blocked (Forbidden)
3. Try direct file access:
   `http://localhost/ITE311-ESYONG/writable/uploads/materials/[filename]`
4. Verify access is denied (Forbidden)

**✅ Expected Result**: 403 Forbidden or similar error

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration Failed
**Solution**: Check database connection in `.env` file

### Issue: Upload Directory Not Found
**Solution**: Ensure `writable/uploads/materials/` exists with proper permissions

### Issue: File Not Uploading
**Solution**: 
- Check PHP upload_max_filesize in php.ini
- Verify post_max_size in php.ini
- Ensure directory is writable (chmod 755)

### Issue: Download Not Working
**Solution**: 
- Verify file exists in uploads directory
- Check file_path in database matches actual location
- Ensure student is enrolled in the course

### Issue: Bootstrap Icons Not Showing
**Solution**: Check internet connection (Bootstrap Icons loaded from CDN)
